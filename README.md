# MyData Agency

This solution is based on a P2P communication model that uses a distributed ledger network to secure the communication channel and verify the integrity of the shared information.

The solution uses **Hyperledger Aries agents** to enable blockchain-rooted, peer-to-peer interactions. It includes a shared cryptographic wallet, as well as a communications protocol for enabling the P2P interaction between identity holders.

The MyData Agency solution includes two types of agents: **a multi-tenant agency** enabling multiple individual users to set up their personal agents with wallets, and **enterprise agent** that an organisation uses to facilitate interactions with the individual agency users.

This wiki describes the MyData Agency solution, their setup protocols and what can be done with them. [Read the wiki to configure and run the project](https://github.com/sitra-ihan/MyData-Agency/wiki)
